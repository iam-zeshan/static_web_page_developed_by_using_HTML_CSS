# Assignment No. 01 (PURE HTML + CSS) at eMumba Intership.

This is the first Assignment that, my Mentor Mr. Muhammad Talha assign to me. I've started working on this task just after completing an HTML + CSS Course
from https://www.freecodecamp.com.

Currently at the time of first commit to GitHub repository, I've completed this task for larger screens, it will display perfectly on larger screen displays except
there are two issues that I didn't solve which are,
No. 01: The content on the Jumbotron is NOT align (vertically).
No. 02: The "Tag Now" form just before Footer is NOT displaying perfectly while I decrease the size of the display.

I'm working on it, for smaller screen by using "@media queries" and other concepts to make it fully responsive.
